# Privacy Policy for Waygoer

**Effective date:** 2026-02-28

Waygoer (“the App”) is a macOS travel planning application. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled when you use the App.

---

## Key points

- **No accounts / no login:** The App does not require registration and does not use user accounts.
- **Your trip data stays with you:** You choose where to store your data (for example locally on your Mac or in your own iCloud Drive). The App does **not** use developer-operated servers to store your trip data.
- **Network access is used for maps:** The App uses Apple MapKit, which may access the network to load map tiles and related map data.
- **No selling / no tracking:** The App does not sell personal data and does not track you across apps and websites.

---

## Data you create in the App

Waygoer lets you create and manage travel planning information such as trip stops, notes, routes, and settings.

This data is stored **only in the storage location you choose**, for example:
- Local storage on your Mac, and/or
- Your own iCloud Drive (recommended if you want syncing across your devices)

**The developer does not receive or have access to your trip data**, because the App does not upload it to any developer-operated servers.

---

## Data the App does not collect

Waygoer does not:
- Require or collect login credentials
- Collect names, email addresses, or other account identifiers through the App
- Sell personal data
- Track you across apps and websites
- Upload your trip data to developer-operated servers

---

## Network access and Apple MapKit

Waygoer uses **Apple MapKit** to display maps. MapKit may contact Apple servers to:
- Load map tiles and map content
- Provide map-related functionality you use in the App

Any data processed by MapKit is handled according to Apple’s policies. Waygoer itself does not run mapping servers and does not send your trip data to developer-operated servers.

---

## iCloud syncing (optional, user-controlled)

If you choose to store Waygoer data in **your own iCloud Drive**, Apple’s iCloud services may sync those files between your devices under your Apple ID.

The developer does not receive your iCloud files and cannot access your Apple ID credentials.

---

## Data retention and deletion

Because your Waygoer data is stored where **you** choose:
- You can delete your data by deleting the files you saved, or by removing the App’s local data (if any).
- If you store files in iCloud Drive, you can delete them from iCloud Drive to remove them and stop syncing.

---

## Security

Reasonable measures are taken to keep the App secure. However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure. You are responsible for the security of the storage location you choose (device access, backups, iCloud settings, etc.).

---

## Children’s privacy

Waygoer is not directed to children under 13 (or the equivalent minimum age in your jurisdiction), and it does not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## Changes to this policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. The updated version will be posted at this URL and the “Effective date” above will be revised.
